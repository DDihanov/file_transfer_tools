this script allows user to select:
1) root folders to copy from, and a destination folder to copy to
2) file formats to look formats
3) a timeout in seconds to repeat the cycle
4) in an event that a file shares the same name with another file and their sizes are equal the file will be ignored, if the size is different,
the original file will be renamed, and then copied in the dest folder
5) the cycle repeats with the given timeout
